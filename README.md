# Wikiart-Parser-By-Painter

There are many wikiart open source parsers, but many of them are not working. As design of wikiart was changed recently. So, I design a parser that will allow you to scrape the data from wikiart based on painter. (In my code I've used example of Niko-Pirosmani, Georgian painter).
