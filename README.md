# Wikiart-Parser-By-Painter

There are many wikiart open source parsers, but many of them are not working. As design of wikiart was changed recently. So, I design a parser that will allow you to scrape the data from wikiart based on painter. (In my code I've used example of Niko-Pirosmani, Georgian painter).

Added parser for https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/view/all?res=1&sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort. see the file parse_david.py.
It runs 6 static threads.
